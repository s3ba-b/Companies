A simple application written in C # (.NET Core) that stores information about companies in Azure SQL Server, including a list of employees and the possibility of management via RESTful Web API. The service starts in self-host mode (in the console).
# How to run the application
Just run the console app and go to https://localhost:5001/company/list
# Supported HTTP queries
Soon I will write about this here.
